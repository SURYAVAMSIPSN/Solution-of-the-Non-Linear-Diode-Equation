# Solution-of-the-Non-Linear-Diode-Equation
This is a project for the course EEE591 - Python for rapid engineering solutions (Spring 2020). It deals with using the SciPy and NumPy libraries for solving the famous diode equation and estimating the solution for the current given certain parameters and constants.

The Diode NonLinear v5c.pdf file consists of the questions needed to be solved for this project. 

The project3.py file is the solution. 

DiodeIV.txt is a given dataset used by project3.py for the second question.
